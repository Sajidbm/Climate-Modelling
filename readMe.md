# Computational fluid dynamics

After working on UAV dynamics simulations for several months, I am taking a step towards climate and weather modelling. I was inspired by work done by the NeuralGCM at Google. Across the industry, Lorenz 96 model is treated as a toy dynamical system to test algorithms to parametrize unresolved processes of a global climate model.
