    "Our task now is to use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ to approximate the simulator $\\mathcal{P}$ created with the Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The properties and functionality of the simulator can be found in the `lorenz63.py` file. We will use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The main task is to learn the parameter(s) $\\theta$ that approxiates $\\mathcal{P}$: $$f_{\\theta} \\approx  \\mathcal{P}$$ The idea is to try to emulate/approximate the Runge-Kutta scheme using a neural network. In RK4, we used previous states to explicitly compute the next state. Now, blind to the scheme, we will try to learn the parameters $\\theta$ of our neural network from the trajectory by having the NN predict the next state given the current state and learned parameters. I will try both cases: with and without noise in the Lorenz simulator. "
